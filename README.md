### **Question 2: Answer any five of the following as directed (2 × 5 = 10 marks)**  
I will answer parts (a), (b), (c), (e), and (g) as they cover a good range of topics and I am confident in providing clear responses.

1. **(a) Mention two instances of non-verbal communication.**  
   Non-verbal communication involves conveying messages without words. Examples include:

2. **(b) Name two modern forms of communication.**  
   Modern communication relies heavily on technology. Two prominent examples are:  
   - Email (electronic mail for quick written correspondence)  
   - Social media (platforms like WhatsApp or Instagram for instant sharing)  
   **Answer:** Email and social media

3. **(c) In what kind of situations are the formal and informal communications used?**  
   - Formal communication is used in professional or official settings, such as business meetings, academic reports, or official letters, where structure and etiquette are important.  
   - Informal communication occurs in casual or personal situations, like conversations with friends or family, where the tone is relaxed and unstructured.  
   **Answer:** Formal communication is used in official or professional situations, while informal communication is used in personal or casual situations.

4. **(e) Do you think listening is important for an effective communication? Why?**  
   Yes, listening is vital for effective communication because it ensures the receiver understands the sender’s message accurately. Without listening, the communication process breaks down as feedback cannot be given properly, leading to misunderstandings.  
   **Answer:** Yes, listening is important for effective communication because it allows the receiver to understand the message and provide appropriate feedback.

5. **(g) Oral communication ensures _______ and _______. (Choose the correct option)**

   Oral communication, being direct and face-to-face, allows the speaker to capture the listener’s attention and receive an immediate response, making it interactive and dynamic. Option (ii) best reflects these qualities.  
   **Answer:** (ii) adequate attention, immediate response

### **Question 3: Answer any three from the following questions (5 × 3 = 15 marks)**  
I will answer parts (a), (d), and (e) as they allow me to elaborate on foundational concepts, challenges, and contemporary aspects of communication.

1. **(a) What is communication? Discuss its importance in our day-to-day life.**  
   Communication is the process of exchanging information, ideas, thoughts, or feelings between individuals or groups using speech, writing, or other means. It involves a sender, a message, a channel, and a receiver, often with feedback to complete the cycle.  
   In day-to-day life, communication is crucial because:  
   - It helps us express our needs, emotions, and opinions (e.g., asking for help or sharing feelings).  
   - It enables the sharing of knowledge (e.g., learning in classrooms or discussing news).  
   - It builds and maintains relationships (e.g., talking with family or friends).  
   - It supports collaboration and problem-solving (e.g., teamwork in projects).  
   - It prevents misunderstandings and resolves conflicts (e.g., clarifying instructions at work).  
   Without communication, social interactions and personal growth would be severely limited.  
   **Answer:** Communication is the process of exchanging information, ideas, thoughts, and feelings through various means. It is essential in daily life for expressing ourselves, sharing knowledge, building relationships, collaborating, solving problems, and making decisions. Effective communication prevents misunderstandings and fosters harmony.

2. **(d) Critically examine the barriers of communication.**  
   Barriers of communication are obstacles that prevent the effective exchange of information. They can be:  
   - **Physical barriers**: Noise, distance, or environmental distractions (e.g., loud sounds interrupting a conversation).  
   - **Language barriers**: Differences in language, accents, or technical jargon (e.g., a student not understanding complex terms).  
   - **Cultural barriers**: Variations in customs or values (e.g., a gesture being polite in one culture but offensive in another).  
   - **Psychological barriers**: Emotions, biases, or stress (e.g., anger causing someone to misinterpret a message).  
   - **Organizational barriers**: Hierarchical structures or poor communication channels in workplaces (e.g., a junior employee hesitant to speak to a senior).  
   These barriers can lead to confusion, conflict, or incomplete understanding. Overcoming them requires using clear language, being empathetic, and choosing suitable communication methods.  
   **Answer:** Barriers of communication include physical (noise, distance), language (differences, jargon), cultural (diverse backgrounds), psychological (emotions, biases), and organizational (hierarchical structures). They hinder effective message exchange, causing misunderstandings. Overcoming them requires awareness, clear language, empathy, and appropriate channels.

3. **(e) How has technology affected human communication system? Prepare a note citing appropriate examples.**  
   Technology has transformed human communication by making it faster, more efficient, and widely accessible:  
   - **Speed and reach**: Email and instant messaging (e.g., WhatsApp) allow instant sharing of messages across the globe.  
   - **Visual connection**: Video conferencing tools like Zoom enable face-to-face talks despite physical distances, useful for remote learning or work.  
   - **Social interaction**: Platforms like Facebook or Twitter connect people worldwide, allowing them to share ideas or organize events.  
   However, it has drawbacks:  
   - **Information overload**: Too many messages or notifications can overwhelm users.  
   - **Reduced personal touch**: Less face-to-face interaction may weaken social bonds (e.g., texting instead of meeting friends).  
   - **Misinformation**: False news spreads quickly online.  
   - **Digital divide**: Not everyone has access to technology (e.g., rural areas with no internet).  
   Overall, technology enhances communication but introduces new challenges.  
   **Answer:** Technology has made communication faster and globally accessible through tools like email, instant messaging, and video conferencing. Social media platforms have created new interaction avenues. However, it has also led to information overload, reduced face-to-face interactions, and misinformation spread. The digital divide further highlights access inequalities.
